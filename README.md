## Foresighting-Technological-Trends - DELOITTE

This report presents a framework for Deloitte to identify the maturity of an emerging technology developed based on four preceding technologies. The AIRS Technology Foresighting Framework presents itself under four pillars: applicability, impact, risks, and sustainability. Each component is defined below:

Applicability: The relevance to business challenges
Impact: The value created to the clientâ€™s business
Risks: The exposure to uncertainties on the client 
Sustainability: The ability to adapt to market changes

Each pillar consists of five assessment questions, all of which are mutually exclusive to the problem statement. The AIRS Technology Foresighting Framework was tested by individuals who have not previously used the assessment on several recent technologies to ensure the validity and minimize biases.

We concluded that this framework is a valid assessment in determining the maturity of emerging technologies. This does not mean that an "immature" technology is not adoptable but may be associated with more challenges than those that are "mature." This assessment should be an initial test for emerging technology for Deloitte. A more stringent evaluation should be performed to identify the adoptability of the given technology.
